> This is a weekend side project. This repo contains a concept PWA. Front end is pure JS but in the future there will be Vue.js and React versions of it. I'm just trying to put in practice at all.

- If you could provide some feedback for my work, it would be perfect, just create an issue. As I said this is just a side project, I'm working on it to strength my programming skills.

- At the end, I'll deploy the project to the Heroku, so you can check the UX, offline mode and other stuff.
